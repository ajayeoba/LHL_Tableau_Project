# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Analyse the FAA wildlife strikes dataset 
Discover differnt hierarchy groups in the dataset
Visualise the Dataset using Tableau
Discover trends and patterns within the data set
Create an interative dashboard to explain the derived insight from the dataset

## Process
### 1. Data Exploration
1. Connected to the FAA wildlife data
2. Detected different data types in your data. for example changed the number engine column to string instead of the initial integer
3. Derived questions based on dataset  

### 2. Data Visualization
Built visualizations to learn about the dataset
Answerd the questions based on the Visualization
 
### 3. Dashboard Creation
Designed an interactive dashboard that allow users visualise the dataset and understand trends and patterns

## Results

I chose option 2 - Creating on Your Own Question and Dashboard
The dataset used for this project is the faa_data_subset data



### Questions and Visualizaton
**Which state was most affected by the Wildlife strike**
 The color heatmap indicated that california has the highest number of strike with a total of 3026 strikes


**Does the number of strike influence the cost of Repair**
The scatter plot visualization which describes the correlation between the number of strikes and cost of repairs shows that the cost of repair does not increase with the number of strikes 

Also more visualization were created which shows that the highest number of strikes occurs every 3rd quarter specifically in August however August has one of the lowest cost of repair. However the hightes cost of repair was seen in January but with a lower number of wild life strike

**What data point influence the cost of Repair**
From the created horizontal bars, it was seen that the degree influences the cost of repair. 

the visualization shows 66,326,155 was the repair cost of 33 destroyed flights with an average cost of $2,009,883 whiile  only about $18,557,982 was the repair cost of 1514 minor damages  with an average cost of $12,257. This shows that the degree of damage impacts the cost of repairs

**Does the number of engine influence the ability of the flight to continue its journey after the impacted strike**
The stacked bar visualization suggests that number of engine affects if the flight can continue operation after impact or will  need to abort.

Flights with 1 engine has the least percentage in zero impact and has the most percentate in aborted takeoffs, precautunary Landing

**what category of widelife animal have the most number of strikes**
The Treemap visualizations suggests that the bird has the most frequest strike with 26,933 strikes within this data set. This is the highest amongst the widelife category

**What category of widelife animal causes the most damage after strike**
The Pie chat Visualization suggests that Terrestial Mammals caused the most damage to the aircraft and hence increasing the cost of repair. Terrestial mammals have a 0.76% chance of destroying the aircraft and a 9.28% chance of causing a substantial damage. This is the highest percentage amongts the widelife categories

## Challenges 
1. Identifying the relevant questions for the dataset
2. Making sure that the visualization tells the story and gives the answers to the asked questions


## Future Goals
Create more visualizations for the dataset and incoperate my questions into a story in Tableau
